# IoT-Based Theft Prevention System

This project was developed during my internship at **Advanced Technology for Smarter & Secured Life (ATSSL), Belagavi** as part of my Electronics and Communication Engineering course under VTU.

## 🔒 Project Overview
The system uses:
- **Raspberry Pi** as the core processor
- **PIR Sensors** to detect motion
- **Relay, Camera, Buzzer** for responsive action
- **GSM Module** to alert the user

When motion is detected, the system:
- Turns on lights
- Rings a buzzer
- Captures image of the intruder
- Sends a GSM alert with the image link

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **PHP for Web Interface**
- **Raspbian Wheezy OS**
- **IoT Hardware Integration**
